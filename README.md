This repository contains a pipeline for:
1. **Assigning** Nepali news articles to 70+ manual topics (with aliases).  
2. **Sub-clustering** each topic via HDBSCAN + TF-IDF.  
3. **Emergent** topic modelling on the leftovers via BERTopic.  
4. A **Streamlit** dashboard to browse by topic and inspect metrics.
